# SnakeGame
This is a snake game created using turtle library in python. The obstacles keep on increasing with successive levels. Also the background theme changes with level. The sounds effects are also great. Great Fun to play.

This game was made as a project for course ES 112 : Computing at IIT Gandhinagar during Semester-1 2018-19. Check out the video.
